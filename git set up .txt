# GitHub workflow (run in Terminal / PowerShell, NOT in R)
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Replace placeholders in <...> with the real URLs / names.
# - You will clone the instructor repo (or workflow repo), then push your work
#   to YOUR OWN GitHub repository for submission.
#
# --- Step A: Clone the instructor repository ---
# 1) Choose (or create) a folder where you want to keep course projects:
#    cd "/Users/songtao/Dropbox/26SP/SODA 501"
#    pwd 
#
# 2) Clone the instructor repo (& rename cloned folder)
#    git clone https://github.com/jfedgerton/soda_501.git soda_501_clones
#
# 3) Move into the repo:
#    cd <soda_501_clones>
#
# 4) (If relevant) move into the relevant week's folder (for example, 02_reproducibility)
#    cd 02_reproducibility
#    ls 
#
# 5) Confirm everything is clean:
#    git status
#
# --- Step B: Create YOUR OWN GitHub repository and push your work ---
# 6) Create a new repo on GitHub (web): e.g., soda501_sp26
#    git init soda501_sp26
#
# 7) Check your current branch name:
#    git branch
#
# 8) Add YOUR repo as a remote called "origin" (if origin is not already set):
#    git remote add origin <https://github.com/songtaoduan/soda501_sp26>
#
# 9) Confirm remotes:
#    git remote -v
#
# 10) Stage, commit, and push your changes: 
#     git add .  
#     git commit -m "PS: reproducible workflow + regressions + plots"
#     git push -u origin main

# "add .  = all files in the current directory and subdirectories"

# FOR LATER WEEKS 
# First, copy weekly subfolder from soda501_clones to soda501_sp26 and rename it as week_x_ps

# cd <"/Users/songtao/Dropbox/26SP/SODA 501">
# ls 
# cp -R soda501_clones/02_reproducibility soda501_sp26/week2_ps


# Then work inside soda501_sp26 folder by changing cd
# Add - Commit - Push 

### cd "/Users/songtao/Dropbox/26SP/SODA 501/soda501_sp26"
### git status
### git add week_2_ps
### git commit -m "PS: week 2"
### git push -u origin main

#  "m allows a log message without opening a text editor"-
